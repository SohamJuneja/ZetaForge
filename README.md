ZetaForge üöÄ
ZetaForge is a revolutionary Web3 platform built on ZetaChain that allows users to fuse their existing NFTs from any blockchain into new, unique, and dynamic digital assets using the power of generative AI.

This project was developed for the ZetaChain X Google Cloud Buildathon. It leverages ZetaChain's Universal Smart Contracts to create a seamless, cross-chain crafting experience, turning static collectibles into evolving, on-chain creations.

‚ú® Core Features
Cross-Chain NFT Fusion: Select and combine NFTs from different blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Base, Polygon) in a single transaction.

AI-Powered Creation: Use simple text prompts to guide a generative AI in creating a brand new, unique image and metadata for your forged asset.

Dynamic, Evolvable NFTs: Forged NFTs have a unique identity, history, and can be upgraded with new traits by re-forging them with other assets.

On-Chain Provenance: Every new creation is minted as a standard ERC-721 NFT on the ZetaChain network, with its own AI-generated lore and stats.
